    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Begin by washing pork spare ribs in cold running water to 
            remove any visible impurities. Then, place pork ribs 
            submerge in a medium pot with a liter of water. Bring to 
            a boil without covering the pot and allow the scum to 
            float to the surface. Meticulously remove the scums from 
            the surface of the water using a slotted spoon or a 
            spatula. Scums are impurities found in meat.
        </li>
        <li>
            After the broth clears up, turn you heat to medium setting, 
            then it's time toss in your onions and tomatoes to add 
            flavor to the broth. Cover your pot and let it simmer to 
            fully cook your meat. Use a fork to pierce the meat so that 
            the flavors would also enter the meaty parts of the spare 
            ribs, You also do this so you can tell if it's already set 
            and tender.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can already add your vegetables. Start by adding the 
            sitaw, kangkong stalks and talong into the pot and cook 
            until these turn dark green. If you decide to use labanos 
            and okra, you can also add those at this point. This 
            should take roughly around 2-3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add in your siling sigang, kangkong leaves and the Knorr 
            Sinigang sa Sampaloc Mix. Stir and let it simmer. It 
            should be done in about 2-3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            All done! Transfer your Sinigang to a serving bowl. This 
            is a happy treat that warms, soothes and satisfies 
            everyone in the family! Remember to prepare extra servings 
            of rice to enjoy the extra asim kilig taste of this 
            Filipino classic soup. Enjoy!
