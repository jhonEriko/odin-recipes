# odin-recipes
This Project is part of my The Odin Project(Foundation Curriculum). This project is titled "Recipes". In this project I'll be using pure html, as what this curriculum's recommendation.

By completing this project I'll be able to create a basic website with text, links, list and images(if needed).
